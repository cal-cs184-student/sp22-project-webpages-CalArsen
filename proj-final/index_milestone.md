## Milk Simulation - The Milestone


## **What We Have Accomplished:**

Thus far, we were able to get a somewhat working version of a 2D fluid simulation, consisting of particle objects that have inter-spatial collision forces between each other. The simulation is also able to accommodate gravitational force as well. Resizing the window additionally lets the user affect the particles on screen by “pushing” the water with one wall.

## **Preliminary Results:**

In preparation for the 3D simulation, we first began coding a 2D simulation so as to get an idea of how to possibly create a 3D one. This is why we still have somewhat of a particle-based system, because our original proposal was to create a 3D-based simulation that worked on a particle structure.

## **Reflection:**

What we have found with the preliminary results is that, while we were able to get a pretty good 2D simulation working, it might still be very difficult to move that to a 3D simulation. There is a lot that needs to be considered with a 3D fluid simulation, and we don’t necessarily know if we can acclimate the 2D existing code to a 3D environment so smoothly. Just having to simulate as many particles as is required for the 3D simulation might provide some difficulty in the long run.

## **Updated Work Plan:**

We want to move on to shaders next, as that will be an important part of the original project design. In terms of updating the project for a 3D environment, this can only be done if the shaders are finished, and we can reasonably complete a 2D simulation of our fluid with the proper shaders, so as to get a working version of some fluid simulator out before attempting a 3D simulator, since a finished project is better than something unfinished.
